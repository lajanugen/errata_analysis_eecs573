 2.0.20      Intermittent Boot Failures   
Workaround: 
  Modify the target board so that the affected device is given a secondary reset on power-up as shown in Figure 6. Two example methods are described in the sections that  follow.  Although secondary resets are compatible with future silicon revisions, they are not required for devices where the root cause has been fixed via an updated DSP boot  ROM. In order to reduce BOM costs, board designers may want to route a reset signal  bypass path so that the workaround circuit can be depopulated on future PCB builds.  ❏ Use a reset supervisor device that includes a watchdog timeout function so that the reset supervisor will issue a secondary reset if the device fails to boot. The watchdog should be serviced with a device signal that is controlled by software. Options for  servicing the watchdog timeout include GPIO, unused clock sources such as  OBSCLK or a periodic output peripheral like TIMER and ePWM.  Some TPS382x reset supervisors include a watchdog function (shown in Figure 9).  34  OMAP-L137 Silicon Revisions 3.0, 2.1, 2.0, 1.1, and 1.0  SPRZ291I – October 2008 – Revised June 2014  Submit Documentation Feedback  Copyright © 2008–2014, Texas Instruments Incorporated      www.ti.com  Silicon Revision 2.0 Usage Notes and Known Design Exceptions to Functional Specifications TPS3820      3.3V   OMAP-L137   VDD  DVDD  GND  GND  Board Reset  MR  WDI  GPIO  RESET      RESET   0-W      Not Populated   Figure 9. Reset Supervisor with Watchdog Function  The watchdog supervisor workaround is easy to implement, however the watchdog  timeout period may exceed application boot-up time requirements. For example, the  TPS3820 has a typical watchdog timeout period of 200ms. The second workaround can  speed up the reset process.  ❏ Implement a logic-based secondary reset circuit which is timed using RC  components. For the circuit shown in Figure 10, a single board reset control signal  can trigger three logic transitions in a dual XOR gate device.

RC-Timed Secondary Reset  This is possible because each RC load connected to the board reset control signal can output a different rising-edge waveform. With increasing RC load, the resulting control signal will reach the Schmitt buffers’ Vih level at a later point in time. Figure 11 shows the relationship between the board reset signal and the RESET signal produced by the circuit. The blue and green lines represent the voltage as seen by the Schmitt buffers.  The output voltage of a charging RC circuit is defined as: Vo = Vi * (1 - e^[-t / RC]) SPRZ291I – October 2008 – Revised June 2014  OMAP-L137 Silicon Revisions 3.0, 2.1, 2.0, 1.1, and 1.0  35  Submit Documentation Feedback   2.0 Usage Notes and Known Design Exceptions to Functional Specifications www.ti.com  R1C1  RESET  R2C2  Vih      Board Reset   Figure 11. RESET Signal vs Board Reset  Given ideal conditions, a 3.3V board reset signal, and an input buffer Vih of 1.4V, the following set of component values would generate an initial RESET high period (R1C1  region) of approximately 2ms and a RESET low period (R2C2 region) of approximately  0.5ms:  •  R1 = 36k, C1 = 100nF  •  R2 = 45k, C2 = 100nF  •  R3 = 450k  When implementing this workaround, some important aspects should be kept in mind:  (a) The dual Schmitt buffer is included because the dual XOR gate has an input rise-time requirement that is violated by the RC circuits.  (b) The Board Reset signal must meet the XOR gate input rise-time requirement and  must provide enough output current to charge the RC circuits to the target Vih level.  (c) It is critical for the Vih level of the two input buffers to be very close together so only single-device buffers should be considered for this circuit (such as the 2-in-1 dual Schmitt buffer device used in this example).  (d) Variations in the electrical characteristics of the circuit components may produce waveforms that deviate from ideal calculations.  (e) The sole purpose of the R3 pull-down resistor is to discharge the RC components  before the board reset signal is driven high. Therefore, the value selected for R3  should be sufficiently large enough to not interfere with the RC circuits as they are charging.  36  OMAP-L137 Silicon Revisions 3.0, 2.1, 2.0, 1.1, and 1.0  SPRZ291I – October 2008 – Revised June 2014  Submit Documentation Feedback   1.1 Usage Notes and Known Design Exceptions to Functional Specifications 5  Silicon Revision 1.1 Usage Notes and Known Design Exceptions to Functional      Specifications   This section describes the usage notes and advisories that apply to silicon revision 1.1 of the OMAP-L137  device .      5.1   Usage Notes for Silicon Revision 1.1  Usage notes highlight and describe particular situations where the device's behavior may not match presumed or documented behavior. This may include behaviors that affect device performance or functional correctness. These usage notes will be incorporated into future documentation updates for the device (such as the device-specific data sheet), and the behaviors they describe will not be altered in future silicon revisions.  Silicon revision 1.1 applicable usage notes have been found on a later silicon revision. For more details, see Section 2.1, Usage Notes for Silicon Revision 3.0.      5.1.1   RTC Standby Power Consumption Is Elevated if the Module Is Not Configured Correctly On Silicon Revision 1.1 and earlier, the RTC module is designed with the ability to keep time while the rest of the device is power cycled off and on. This ability is achieved by placing the RTC in its own power domain and isolating it from the device reset signal.  When the CVDD supply is powered down, the RTC_CVDD supply will experience elevated standby power consumption because of leakage between the RTC and core power domains. The RTC module includes circuitry that eliminates the leakage paths between the two domains when the SPLITPOWER bit is set to 1  in the control register (CTRL). The SPLITPOWER bit is a write-only bit that will always read back 0.  Therefore, typical read-modify-write sequences should not be used when writing to the CTRL register because the SPLITPOWER bit will be cleared back to 0.  Also note that the SPLITPOWER bit has a default value of 0 after RTC module reset, and the only reset available to the RTC module is a software reset, therefore RTC is in an indeterminate state when the RTC_CVDD supply is first powered on. The RTC module should be reset, and the SPLITPOWER bit should be set to 1 before placing the device in a CVDD powered down standby state. The SPLITPOWER  bit is permanently set to 1 inside the RTC module beginning with Silicon Revision 2.0 of the device.      5.1.2   SYSCFG: Possible Race Condition When Using KICK Registers  On Silicon Revision 1.1 and earlier, when two or more threads are simultaneously accessing the SYSCFG  registers, there is the potential for one thread to lock the SYSCFG registers while another thread is still accessing them. There is no hardware semaphore to prevent this from occurring.  For example, the race condition can occur in the following situation  1. Thread 1 unlocks the SYSCFG register by writing to the KICK registers  2. An interrupt occurs and Thread 2 unlocks the SYSCFG registers as well  3. Thread 2 finishes and locks the SYSCFG registers  4. Thread 1 is locked out of the SYSCFG registers and is unable to complete its task To prevent the SYSCFG lockout race condition, the application should unlock the SYSCFG registers via the KICK registers and leave them permanently unlocked.  Starting with silicon revision 2.0, the KICK registers will be disabled and the SYSCFG registers will be permanently accessible. Writes to the disabled KICK registers will have no effect.      5.2   Silicon Revision 1.1 Known Design Exceptions to Functional Specifications  Some silicon revision 1.1 applicable advisories have been found on a later silicon revision.

 2.3.24   Boot: ECC Data Error in Spare Area Causes NAND Boot Failure  
Workaround: 
:  The workaround ignores errors in ECC data (these errors do not need to be corrected) so that the boot process can continue, correcting errors in the user data (up to 4 bit errors total), as necessary. The workaround also includes a mechanism to restart the NAND read process from the next good block if an uncorrectable error (more than 4 bit errors) is detected on any page of a good block.  This workaround is implemented using a software patch that is loaded in device RAM at boot time and is designed to change the default behavior of the ECC Correct and Read functions in the RBL. The patch binary replaces function pointers to the ECC Correct and Read functions in the ROM function table, (defined in device internal memory), during boot. The patch binary will reside in page0 of the NAND block and so will be applied only after the page0 of a good block has been read.  Once the patch is read, all subsequent page reads in the block will use the new ECC  Correct and Read functions. ECC data errors on any page (other than page0) are ignored, any user data error (up to 4 bit errors total) is corrected and the boot process continues. If an uncorrectable error is detected on any page, the block is skipped and the boot process is restarted on the next good block. The behavior of the device boot from the NAND after application of the patch is shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12.

Application of the Software Patch to NAND Boot Images:  •  For the GUI tool, AISGEN.exe version 1.11 or later (found in the install directory), the patch integrates the modified ECC Correct function into the user application file to generate one binary AIS file.  •  For the Command line AIS tool, HEXAIS_OMAP_L138.exe users (found in the install directory), the patch can be integrated into the user application file to generate one binary AIS file by inserting lines below to the end of the INI configuration file.

Once page0 has been read successfully, the AIS set command will overwrite the function pointer in the RBL with the modified function pointer and the modified function will be applied to the later pages read. Memory usage of the patch at boot time is as follows:  –  500 bytes at location 0xFFFF 0B00  Recommendations to Improve Robustness:  •  Page0 should be stored on multiple blocks as backup to take advantage of the safety mechanism built into Silicon Revision 2.1 to cycle to the next block when a page0  read fails in a good block.  •  Maintain backup boot images in multiple blocks. The patch to the Abort function reinitializes the boot process and forces the boot to cycle to the next good block and restart the boot process by reading from it.  •  Silicon Revision 2.1 supports booting from Block 0 of the flash which many NAND  manufacturers guarantee as a “more reliable” block than all other blocks. Hence, setting up boot to start from that Block 0 could help improve the reliability of boot.  This is a hardware change, requiring the bootmode pins BOOT[6:5] = 1x.

The workaround also includes a mechanism to restart the NAND read process from the next good block if an uncorrectable error (more than 4 bit errors) is detected on any page of a good block.  This workaround is implemented using a software patch that is loaded in device RAM at boot time and is designed to change the default behavior of the ECC Correct and Read functions in the RBL. The patch binary replaces function pointers to the ECC Correct and Read functions in the ROM function table, (defined in device internal memory),  during boot. The patch binary will reside in page0 of the NAND block and so will be applied only after the page0 of a good block has been read.  Once the patch is read, all subsequent page reads in the block will use the new ECC  Correct and Read functions. ECC data errors on any page (other than page0) are  ignored, any user data error (up to 4 bit errors total) is corrected and the boot process continues. If an uncorrectable error is detected on any page, the block is skipped and the boot process is restarted on the next good block. The behavior of the device boot from the NAND after application of the patch is shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12. D800K008 ROM Behavior With Software Patch Applied(1)  The software patch is available as a pre-built file with the latest version of the AIS tool that is used to generate the NAND flash boot image. The Using the OMAP-L132/L138  Bootloader Application Report (Literature number: SPRAB41) provides a link to the install package for the AIS tool which includes the following in the install directory: prebuilt patch files, the GUI AIS generation tool (AISGEN.exe, version 1.11 or later), command-line AIS generation tool and an example INI file.  Application of the Software Patch to NAND Boot Images:  •  For the GUI tool, AISGEN.exe version 1.11 or later (found in the install directory), the patch integrates the modified ECC Correct function into the user application file to generate one binary AIS file.  •  For the Command line AIS tool, HEXAIS_OMAP_L138.exe users (found in the install  directory), the patch can be integrated into the user application file to generate one binary AIS file by inserting lines below to the end of the INI configuration file.  The patch name is: ARM_nand_ecc_patch_OMAP-L138.out  36  OMAP-L138 C6000 DSP+ARM® Processor Silicon Revisions 2.3, 2.1, 2.0,  SPRZ301M – June 2009 – Revised March 2014  1.1 and 1.0  Submit Documentation Feedback  Copyright © 2009–2014, Texas Instruments Incorporated  www.ti.com  Silicon Revision 2.3 Usage Notes and Known Design Exceptions to Functional Specifications  [INPUTFILE] ; get the NAND ECC patch file  FILENAME=Patch_name.out  ; patch the NAND ECC handling routine  [AIS_Jump]  LOCATION=_NAND_ECC_patchApply  •  The patch will be burnt on page0, as it is in the head of AIS file. Once page0 has  been read successfully, the AIS set command will overwrite the function pointer in the RBL with the modified function pointer and the modified function will be applied to the later pages read. Memory usage of the patch at boot time is as follows:  –  500 bytes at location 0xFFFF 0B00  Recommendations to Improve Robustness:  •  Page0 should be stored on multiple blocks as backup to take advantage of the safety mechanism built into Silicon Revision 2.1 to cycle to the next block when a page0  read fails in a good block.  •  Maintain backup boot images in multiple blocks. The patch to the Abort function  reinitializes the boot process and forces the boot to cycle to the next good block and restart the boot process by reading from it.  •  Silicon Revision 2.1 supports booting from Block 0 of the flash which many NAND  manufacturers guarantee as a “more reliable” block than all other blocks. Hence,  setting up boot to start from that Block 0 could help improve the reliability of boot.  This is a hardware change, requiring the bootmode pins BOOT[6:5] = 1x.

 2.3.18  DVDD18 Can Pull Up to 2.7V When Using Dual-Voltage IOs at 3.3V  
Workaround: 
  1. Design simulation has indicated that under the worst-case  process/voltage/temperature conditions the maximum leakage current into the  DVDD18 supply due to this phenomenon will be 140 mA (the 140 mA is a cumulative  current generated by all of the dual-voltage IOs). So this error state can be prevented by ensuring that the load on the DVDD18 supply during the DVDD13318_x supply  ramp exceeds 140 mA. This can be achieved by any combination of the following as  long as they cumulatively produce >140 mA load on DVDD18 during the  DVDD3318_x ramp period:  (a) Maintain sufficient bulk capacitance on the DVDD18 supply such that the charging current for these capacitors provides all or part of the required >140 mA. Bulk  capacitance in this context means the total capacitance seen by the DVDD18  supply (filter capacitors, bypass capacitors, etc.). Capacitor charging current is  defined as I = C*(dV/dt). So the ramp rate of the DVDD3318_x supply and the  total bulk capacitance on the DVDD18 supply can be used to calculate the current  produced. This solution provides additional power supply filtering and little current leakage after the supplies are ramped (depending on the type of capacitors used).  The table below shows some examples of the bulk capacitance that would be  required to use this solution alone:  Table 12. Bulk Capacitance  DVDD3318_x ramp  dV/dt (in V per second)  Required capacitance to generate 140 mA  time for 3.3V  100 µs  33000  4.2 µF  250 µs  13200  10.6 µF  500 µs  6600  21.2 µF  1 ms  3300  42.4 µF  10 ms  330  424.2 µF  (b) Use an additional shunt regulator to control the voltage at DVDD18. The shunt  regulator is placed between DVDD18 and Vss. As an example, the TLVH431 can  provide up to 70 mA of additional load current to help maintain the DVDD18  voltage. When the voltage drops back to the normal 1.8V range, the current flow  through the shunt regulator drops into the <100 uA range. This solution requires the shunt regulator and two additional resistors to set the desired regulation  voltage.  (c) Use a resistor to provide additional load between DVDD18 and Vss. This solution is less desirable since it continues to draw power even after the supply ramp is  completed but would likely be the lowest cost. An improvement is to use a  FET/switch in series with the resistor between DVDD18 and Vss that can later be  turned off (by the RESET signal or a GPIO signal for example).

Choose a regulator for the DVDD18 supply (or grouped 1.8V supplies) that is  capable of actively regulating voltage up and down. Many high-efficiency switching  regulators switch current into the load only when the voltage needs to be raised and rely on the load to pulldown the current. In this error condition, a regulator of this type will not be able to compensate for the leakage current described above.  Synchronous buck regulators use external inductance to pulldown the regulated  voltage when necessary.  28  OMAP-L138 C6000 DSP+ARM® Processor Silicon Revisions 2.3, 2.1, 2.0,  SPRZ301M – June 2009 – Revised March 2014  1.1 and 1.0  Submit Documentation Feedback  Copyright © 2009–2014, Texas Instruments Incorporated  www.ti.com  Silicon Revision 2.3 Usage Notes and Known Design Exceptions to Functional Specifications

Failure: 
2.9 Waking up from sleep mode 
Workaround: 
s Workaround solutions include: 1. Use the 32 kHz RTC clock as the clock source for sleep mode: a) Select the RTC clock as the CPU clock source prior entering sleep mode. b) The CPU wakes up following any of the three wakeup events and waits for the crystal to start oscillation. A crystal startup time is about 1.5 ms typical. c) After the crystal wakes up, the CPU waits for a tWAIT time before the first code is fetched from Flash memory. The software can then change the CPU clock source back to the OSC or PLL clock. The duration of tWAIT depends on the crystal frequency. tWAIT equals 50 Âµs at 25 MHz and 312 Âµs at 4 MHz. 2. Instead of a crystal, use an oscillator as STR91xFA clock source. This limitation will not be fixed in future silicon revisions

 Since this issue only occurs with NOR FLASH, using one of the other boot methods such as NAND or SPI FLASH boot is a good workaround for the issue. If booting from NOR FLASH is a requirement, the simple circuit shown in Figure 3 can be used to clear the SDRAM state at system reset. This will not change the normal functioning of the LPC3220 EMC or SDRAM operations.

Query: The LCD flicker issue is not completely resolved by the use of dummy DMA transfer (See Erratum number 7). The LCDC DMA high/low setting does not ensure that the next bus request is triggered in the event the current DMA burst is not completed. The problem occurs when the next bus request is initiated while the LCDC is waiting for the last data in the current DMA burst. This is because when the LCDC is waiting for the last data, it only expects an HREADY signal to be asserted. So, if the next bus request is triggered while the LCDC is waiting, the bus request will be missed. A data fetch can not be initiated while data in FIFO is being continuously drained so an under-run will eventually occur. In Summary: If the next bus request is issued when the LCDC is waiting for the last data in the current DMA burst it will not be recognized.

Failure: 
The Memory Controller  arbiter (MEMC) does not break  and release the ARMâ¢ coreâs  back-to-back burst access to the  other (for example, LCDC, DMA,  and MMA) bus masters. In this  situation, the ARM coreâs back-toback access does not use an IDLE  cycle as a separator.
Workaround: 
 Use a dummy DMA transfer to and from a dummy memory  space to force the MEMC to release the bus for other bus  masters. For more detailed information and code example,  please visit our website www.freescale.com/imx.

In word-wide frame-sync mode, if SSI_EN and TX/RX_EN are set near new frame start, SSI Receive and Transmit does not function properly and there is a chance of words getting missed/shifted or transmit data line being driven low for 1/2 clock cycles during the first frame.
Workaround: 
To ensure a gap of at least 2 bit-clock cycles between SSI_EN and TX/RX bit setting (only for External word-wide frame-sync patterns), here is an example code for this workaround. void ssi_transmit_receive_test() { //parameters defined here Statement1 (); //clock configuration here Statement2(); //AUDMUX configuration here Statement3(); //SSI configuration here Statement4(); //Enable SSI by programming SSI_SCR MEMWD(SSI2_SCR,scr_mask1); //delay some time for the SSI state machine to function //properly for(i=0;i<=5;i++); //Enable transmit and receive of SSI by programming //SSI_SCR MEMWD(SSI2_SCR,scr_mask2); ...... }

Failure: 
Limitation on using DMA  for USBD IN data transfer.  There is a limitation on using DMA  to transfer continuous data from  memory to a 64-byte USBD FIFO  (FIFO1 and FIFO2) when using a  short packet (<37 bytes) followed  by a long packet (> 32 bytes).  For example: A 6 byte packet  followed by a 64 byte packet, or a  32 byte packet followed by a 40  byte packet such that the short  packet length + the long packet  length is greater than 64 bytes  (FIFO depth).
Workaround: 
 Two methods are used to prevent this limitation depending on  the data packet size:  1. For data packet sizes of less than 5 bytes:  After the short packet data transfer, software must poll the  USBD BYTE_COUNT==0 before initiating the next DMA  transfer. This ensures that FIFO can accept the next long  data packet of 64-bytes.  2. For data packet sizes of 5 bytes and greater:  Use a 32-byte FIFO instead of a 64-byte FIFO to ensure that  the DMA request is cleared. The granularity bits GR[2:0] must  be set to 111.

3.3 DDR.2: DDR EMC_D[15:0] to EMC_DQS[1:0] data output set-up time, tsu(Q), for MCU write to DDR provides limited timing margin Remark: This affects both 1.8 V mobile and 2.5 V DDR SDRAM system implementations. 
Workaround: 
 To get the most DDR set-up time margin, the following is recommended: 1. The DDR initialization software should set the SDRAMCLK_CTRL register (0x4000 4068) SDRAM_PIN_SPEED[3:1] bits = 0 (fast slew rate). This is for both 1.8 V mobile and 2.5 V DDR memories. 2. Systems requiring 128 MB or less of DDR should be implemented using a single EMC_DYCSx_N for DDR. The single chip select system may be constructed with a single 16-bit wide DDR or two 8-bit wide DDR SDRAMs using up to the maximum supported 512 Mbit DDR density. Using two 8-bit wide DDRs will have less capacitive loading and facilitate simple point-to-point routing of EMC_D[15:0] and EMC_DQS[1:0] signals over using two 16-bit DDRs and two EMC_DYCSx banks.

If series termination resistors are used they should be placed as close to the DDR EMC_D[15:0] and EMC_DQS[1:0] pins as possible. 4. If the data bus EMC_D[15:0] is shared with additional devices (i.e., NOR flash, buffers, etc.) the board should be routed with a daisy chain topology, where the LPC3220 is placed at one extreme of the data bus and the DDR(s) at the other extreme. Other device(s) should be placed between the LPC3220 and DDR memory (closer to the DDR). 5. The PCB trace length of EMC_DQS[1:0] should be at least 2 inches (but not more than 4 inches) longer than EMC_DQ[15:0] and EMC_DQM[1:0]. On a typical FR4 PCB this adds at least 334 ps to set-up time margin for DDR writes. For reads from DDR the increased trace length of EMC_DQS[1:0] will be automatically compensated for by the software initialization function find_ddr_dqsin_delay() which sets the optimal value DDR_DQSIN_DELAY(SDRAMCLK_CTRL[6:2]). The function find_ddr_dqsin_delay() can be found in the "DDR SDRAM setup code for the LPC32x0 series" on the NXP web site.

Failure: 
Lockup of Video Codec in MPEG-4 encode or decode Note: Applies only to silicon revision 2.0
Workaround: 
â¢Set the Latency Hiding Disable (LHD) bit in the ESDCTL DDR Controller ESDMISC register. This adds latency between DDR transactions, removing the ideal data throughput. This should only be done during MPEG-4 encoding and decoding. Note that this reduces performance. During MPEG-4 encoding/decoding, this degradation is acceptable. LHD should not be set during H.264 or H.263 operation. â¢Assign all buffers accessed by the video code into the same DRAM bank and ensure every buffer type has a size of integer number of pages. This ensures that there is a page miss between accesses of different sub-masters inside the VPU, increasing the delay. The DRAM is split into four equal sizes called banks, so the bank size is 1/4 of the DRAM size.

Workaround: 
  Although there is no specific workaround, the following recommendations can be used to help prevent this issue:  •  Minimize loads as much as possible, especially DC loads that could cause the Vil to rise. Point-to-point (single-load) connections are unlikely to be affected.  •  Falling edges should transition as rapidly as possible (so the signal passes through the 0.2V point as early as possible). Heavily loaded nodes resulting in degraded fall times may require drivers to provide rapid input edges.

Workaround: 
:  The workaround ignores errors in ECC data (these errors do not need to be corrected) so that the boot process can continue, correcting errors in the user data (up to 4 bit errors total), as necessary. The workaround also includes a mechanism to restart the NAND read process from the next good block if an uncorrectable error (more than 4 bit errors) is detected on any page of a good block.  This workaround is implemented using a software patch that is loaded in device RAM at boot time and is designed to change the default behavior of the ECC Correct and Read functions in the RBL. The patch binary replaces function pointers to the ECC Correct and Read functions in the ROM function table, (defined in device internal memory), during boot.

If an uncorrectable error is detected on any page, the block is skipped and the boot process is restarted on the next good block.

The IRC frequency spec is 4 MHz +/ï­ 1 % accuracy over the entire voltage and temperature range. During In-System Programming (ISP), the auto-baud routine is expecting the IRC frequency to be 4 MHz +/ï­ 1 % and is used to synchronize with the host via serial port 0. Problem: On the LPC247X Rev D device (only with date codes 0949 and before), the accuracy of internal RC oscillator (IRC) frequency does not meet the 4 MHz +/ï­ 1 % specification for temperatures between ï­20 ï°C and ï­40 ï°C and the accuracy of internal RC oscillator (IRC) frequency is 4 MHz +/ï­ 5 % instead. As a result, only at these temperatures, this may affect the auto-baud routine's ability to synchronize with the host via serial port 0 during In-System Programming (ISP) at higher baud rates. For temperatures above ï­20 ï°C, the accuracy of internal RC oscillator (IRC) frequency meets the 4 MHz +/ï­ 1 % specification. Work-around: None 5.

Care must be taken to limit the current to less than 4 mA by using a series limiting resistor. 5.2 Note.2 On the LPC2470/78 Rev D, design changes to the Memory Accelerator Module were made to enhance timing and general performance. Design changes are intended to enhance performance in general and will result in minor differences in the code execution timing between the previous device revisions and rev D. Actual performance impact is code dependent, some code sequences may speed up while other code sequences may slow down between the previous device revisions and rev D. This might be observed when using software delays and in such cases, a hardware timer should be used to generate a delay instead of a software delay. ES_LPC2470_78 . Â© NXP B.V. 2012.

The Using the OMAP-L132/L138  Bootloader Application Report (Literature number: SPRAB41) provides a link to the install package for the AIS tool which includes the following in the install directory: prebuilt patch files, the GUI AIS generation tool (AISGEN.exe, version 1.11 or later), command-line AIS generation tool and an example INI file.  Application of the Software Patch to NAND Boot Images:  •  For the GUI tool, AISGEN.exe version 1.11 or later (found in the install directory), the patch integrates the modified ECC Correct function into the user application file to generate one binary AIS file.  •  For the Command line AIS tool, HEXAIS_OMAP_L138.exe users (found in the install  directory), the patch can be integrated into the user application file to generate one binary AIS file by inserting lines below to the end of the INI configuration file.

Once page0 has  been read successfully, the AIS set command will overwrite the function pointer in the RBL with the modified function pointer and the modified function will be applied to the later pages read. Memory usage of the patch at boot time is as follows:  –  500 bytes at location 0xFFFF 0B00  Recommendations to Improve Robustness:  •  Page0 should be stored on multiple blocks as backup to take advantage of the safety mechanism built into Silicon Revision 2.1 to cycle to the next block when a page0  read fails in a good block.  •  Maintain backup boot images in multiple blocks. The patch to the Abort function  reinitializes the boot process and forces the boot to cycle to the next good block and restart the boot process by reading from it.  •  Silicon Revision 2.1 supports booting from Block 0 of the flash which many NAND  manufacturers guarantee as a “more reliable” block than all other blocks. Hence,  setting up boot to start from that Block 0 could help improve the reliability of boot.  This is a hardware change, requiring the bootmode pins BOOT[6:5] = 1x.

Failure: 
 2.3.24   Boot: ECC Data Error in Spare Area Causes NAND Boot Failure  
Workaround: 
:  The workaround ignores errors in ECC data (these errors do not need to be corrected) so that the boot process can continue, correcting errors in the user data (up to 4 bit errors total), as necessary. The workaround also includes a mechanism to restart the NAND read process from the next good block if an uncorrectable error (more than 4 bit errors) is detected on any page of a good block.  This workaround is implemented using a software patch that is loaded in device RAM at boot time and is designed to change the default behavior of the ECC Correct and Read functions in the RBL. The patch binary replaces function pointers to the ECC Correct and Read functions in the ROM function table, (defined in device internal memory), during boot. The patch binary will reside in page0 of the NAND block and so will be applied only after the page0 of a good block has been read.  Once the patch is read, all subsequent page reads in the block will use the new ECC  Correct and Read functions. ECC data errors on any page (other than page0) are ignored, any user data error (up to 4 bit errors total) is corrected and the boot process continues. If an uncorrectable error is detected on any page, the block is skipped and the boot process is restarted on the next good block. The behavior of the device boot from the NAND after application of the patch is shown in Figure 12.

Failure: 
3.5 DDR.1: DDR interface has >1.2 ns clock skew 
Workaround: 
 Connecting the DDR device negative clock input (DDR_nCLK from the LPC3240) to the DDR Reference Voltage (Vref - the midpoint of the DDR signal voltage swing, which is generally VDDQ/2) avoids the clock skew problem, though it also eliminates the advantages of differential signaling. The LPC3240 DDR_nCLK output should be left unconnected. DDR Reference Voltage can be generated with a divide-by-two voltage divider. Standard DDR memories usually require a Vref input, so this DDR reference voltage should already be available. Mobile DDR devices typically do not have a Vref input, so the external voltage divider may need to be added to the design for this work-around. It is also possible to compensate for the 1.27 ns clock skew by adding an additional 7 inches of pcb trace length to the EMC_CLK signal. However, this could have unintentional consequences; such as increased Electro-Magnetic Interference. ES_LPC3240 . Â©   Rev. 9 â 1 June 2011 11 of 17  ES_LPC3240  LPC3240

 3.0.21  SDMA Activity Can Corrupt L1D When L2 Is Configured as Mixed/C ache/SRAM  
Workaround: 
  Method 1: Do not perform two CPU read operations in the same clock cycle. For C  code, use compiler flag (--c64p_dma_l1d_workaround) available in the C6000  Compiler (CodeGen) Tools version 7.0.2 and later. For assembly code, the --  c64p_dma_l1d_workaround flag will only issue a warning.  Method 2: In cases where buffer access will not be shared between CPU and SDMA, unintended CPU/SDMA cache-line sharing can be avoided by aligning CPU and SDMA  buffers to 64-byte boundaries. Aligning buffers to 64-byte boundaries will result in wasted space, however it ensures that the CPU and SDMA buffers will not have partial  segments which overlap into the same L1D cache line.  /** Pseudo code only **/  Uint8 *SDMA_BUFF, *CPU_BUFF;  /* 64-byte aligned allocation Option 1 */  SDMA_BUFF = malloc( (Int32) (( SDMA_BUFF_SIZE + 63)/64) * 64 );  CPU_BUFF = malloc( (Int32) ((CPU_BUFF_SIZE + 63)/64) * 64 );  SDMA_BUFF = (Uint8 *) ( (Int32) SDMA_BUFF & ~63 );  CPU_BUFF = (Uint8 *) ( (Int32) CPU_BUFF & ~63 );  /* 64-byte aligned allocation Option 2 with BIOS Call */  SDMA_BUFF = MEM_alloc( IRAM, SDMA_BUFF_SIZE, 64 );  CPU_BUFF = MEM_alloc( IRAM, CPU_BUFF_SIZE, 64 );  20  OMAP-L137 Silicon Revisions 3.0, 2.1, 2.0, 1.1, and 1.0  SPRZ291I – October 2008 – Revised June 2014  Submit Documentation Feedback   3.0 Usage Notes and Known Design Exceptions to Functional Specifications Method 3 Manage access to a 64-byte boundary aligned buffer that is shared between CPU and SDMA by implementing a semaphore and forcing cache writeback operations if  there are CPU writes. With this method, the semaphore ensures that there is clear  ownership of the buffer between CPU and SDMA, and the CPU manages cache  coherence by using explicit cache writeback operations.  /** Pseudo code only **/  /* Example with EDMA as the external master */  EDMA_ISR() {  /* EDMA releases ownership of buffer */  SEM_post(SyncSemaphore);  return;  }  main() {  while(COND) {  /* CPU waits for ownership of buffer */  SEM_pend(SyncSemaphore);  /**********************/  /*** CPU Processing ***/  /**********************/  /* Cache writeback for shared block */  /* Buffer must be 64-byte aligned */  BCACHE_wbInv( blockPtr, blockSize, WAIT );  /* Initiate EDMA */  EDMA_Event_Generate();  }  }  Method 4 Do not allow SDMA to access L2 RAM. SDMA can use buffers in L1D RAM or Shared RAM instead of L2 RAM.  Method 5 Configure the entire L2 RAM as cache. Critical peripheral data can be accessed in L1D RAM or Shared RAM instead of L2 RAM.

Query: 3.26 Reset.1: Device does not power up correctly under certain internal conditions Problem: If certain rare chip-internal conditions are met, the device will not start up correctly when executing a power-on reset. The crystal oscillator will be running but the device will not execute code. Work-around: Apply a second (warm) reset pulse (without power-on cycle). The minimum time requirement between the first (unsuccessful) reset and the second reset is 4105 external oscillator clock cycles, which means that the assertion of the second reset should occur 4105 cycles or more after the deassertion of the first reset. For example, at 10 MHz, this is equal to 411 ï­s; at 20 MHz, this is equal to 206 ï­s. This can be achieved by using an external watchdog timer or by any other circuitry in the application that is able to assert a second reset pulse. The root cause for this problem has been identified and will be fixed from Revision B of this device onwards. This problem will also be fixed in the LPC21x9/00 version of this device which will have a dedicated order number (LPC21x9FBD64/00). ES_LPC2109_19_29_00 .

3.5 Timer.1: In counter mode, the Timer Counter reset does not occur on the correct incoming edge Problem: Timer0 and Timer1 can be used in a counter mode. In this mode, the Timer Counter register can be incremented on rising, falling or both edges which occur on a selected CAP input pin. This counter mode can be combined with the match functionality to provide additional features. One of the features would be to reset the Timer Counter register on a match. The same would also apply for Timer1. Work-around: There are two possible workarounds: 1. Combine the Timer Counter reset feature with the âinterrupt on matchâ feature. The interrupt on match occurs on the correct incoming edge. In the ISR, the Timer Counter register can also be reset. This solution can only work if no edges are expected during the duration of the ISR. 2. In this solution, the âinterrupt on matchâ feature is not used. Instead, the following specific initialization can achieve the counting operation: a. Initialize the Timer Counter register to 0xFFFFFFFF. b. If ânâ edges have to be counted then initialize the corresponding Match register with value n-1. For instance, if 2 edges need to be counted then load the Match register with value 1. More details on the above example: 1. Edge 1 - Timer overflows and Timer Counter (TC) is set to 0. 2. Edge 2 - TC=1. Match takes place. 3. Edge 3 - TC=0. 4. Edge 4 - TC=1. Match takes place. 5.

The affected peripherals can be placed into halted states by halting the ARM CPU.

CCS also  includes the ability to simultaneously set debug states (such as RUN and HALT) across multiple processors. When the ARM and DSP both run and halt at the same time, the  peripherals will appear as if their suspend source is the DSP.  56  OMAP-L138 C6000 DSP+ARM® Processor Silicon Revisions 2.3, 2.1, 2.0,  SPRZ301M – June 2009 – Revised March 2014  1.1 and 1.0  Submit Documentation Feedback  Copyright © 2009–2014, Texas Instruments Incorporated  www.ti.com  Silicon Revision 1.1 Usage Notes and Known Design Exceptions to Functional Specifications

3.2 NOR.1: When booting from NOR flash, SDRAM devices will not release the data bus, preventing the LPC3220 from booting correctly 
Workaround: 
 Since this issue only occurs with NOR FLASH, using one of the other boot methods such as NAND or SPI FLASH boot is a good workaround for the issue. If booting from NOR FLASH is a requirement, the simple circuit shown in Figure 3 can be used to clear the SDRAM state at system reset. This will not change the normal functioning of the LPC3220 EMC or SDRAM operations. If SDRAM devices are also present on the 2nd SDRAM chip select, a similar circuit will be needed for those devices using EMC_CKE1. ES_LPC3220 .
