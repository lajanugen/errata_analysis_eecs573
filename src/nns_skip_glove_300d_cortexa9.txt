ARM: 743623âBad interaction between a minimum of seven PLDs and one Non-Cacheable LDM can lead to a deadlock 
Details: 
 Under very rare circumstances, a deadlock can happen in the processor when it is handling a minimum of seven PLD instructions, shortly followed by one LDM to an uncacheable memory location. The LDM is treated as uncacheable in the following cases: â¢ The LDM is performed while the Data Cache is OFF â¢ The LDM is targeting a memory region marked as Strongly Ordered, Device, Normal Memory Non-Cacheable, or Normal Memory Write-Through â¢ The LDM is targeting a memory region marked as Shareable Normal Memory Write-Back, and the CPU is in AMP mode. Conditions: The code sequence that exhibits this erratum requires at least seven PLDs, shortly followed by one LDM, to an uncacheable memory region. The erratum happens when the LDM appears on the AXI bus before any of the seven PLDs. This can possibly happen if the first PLD is a miss in the micro-TLB; in that case, it needs to perform a TLB request which might not be serviced immediately because the mainTLB is already performing a Page Table Walk for another resource (for example, instruction side), or because the PLD request itself to the mainTLB is missing and causing a Page Table Walk. Also note that the above conditions are not sufficient to recreate the failure, as additional rare conditions on the internal state of the processor are necessary to exhibit the errata.

ARM: 743626âAn imprecise external abort, received while the processor enters WFI, may cause a processor deadlock 
Details: 
 An imprecise external abort received while the processor is ready to enter into WFI state might cause a processor deadlock. Explicit memory transactions can be completed by inserting a DSB before the WFI instruction. However, this does not prevent memory accesses generated by previously issued PLD instructions page table walks associated with previously issued PLD instructions or as a result of the PLE engine. If an external abort is returned as a result of one of these memory accesses after executing a WFI instruction, the processor can cause a deadlock.

ARM: 743622âFaulty logic in the Store Buffer may lead to data corruption 
Details: 
 Under very rare conditions, a faulty optimization in the CortexÂ®-A9 store buffer might lead to data corruption. Conditions: The code sequence which exhibits the failure requires at least five cacheable writes in 64-bit data chunk: â¢ Three of the writes must be in the same cache line â¢ Another write must be in a different cache line â¢ All of the above four writes hit in the L1 data cache â¢ A fifth write is required in any of the above two cache lines that fully writes a 64-bit data chunk With the above code sequence, under very rare circumstances, this fifth write might get corrupted, with the written data either being lost, or being written in another cache line. The conditions under which the erratum can occur are extremely rare, and require the coincidence of multiple events and states in the Cortex-A9 micro-architecture. As an example: letâs assume A, Aâ, Aâ, and Aâââ are all in the same cache lineâB and Bâ are in another cache line. The following code sequence might trigger the erratum: STR A STR Aâ STR Aââ STR B STR Aâââ (or STR Bâ) At the time where the first four STR are in the Cortex-A9 store buffer, and the fifth STR arrives at a very precise cycle in the Store Buffer input stage, then the fifth STR might not see its cache line dependency on the previous STR instructions. Because of this, in cases when the cache line A or B gets invalidated due to a coherent request from another CPU, the fifth STR might write in a faulty cache line, causing data corruption. An alternative version of the erratum might happen even without a coherent request â In the case when the fifth STR is a 64-bit write in the same location as one of A, Aâ, Aââ, then the erratum might also be exhibited. Note that this is a quite uncommon scenario because it requires a first write to a memory location that is immediately and fully overwritten.

ARM/MP: 764319âRead accesses to DBGPRSR and DBGOSLSR may generate an unexpected UNDEF 
Details: 
 CP14 read accesses to the DBGPRSR and DBGOSLSR registers generate an unexpected UNDEFINED exception when the DBGSWENABLE external pin is set to 0, even when the CP14 accesses are performed from a privileged mode.

ERR003732 ARM: 751471âDBGPCSR format is incorrect 
Details: 
 About the DBGPCSR register, the ARM architecture specifies that: â¢ DBGPCSR[31:2] contains sampled value of bits [31:2] of the PC. The sampled value is an instruction address plus an offset that depends on the processor instruction set state. â¢ DBGPCSR[1:0] contains the meaning of PC sample value, with the following permitted values: â 0b00 ((DBGPCSR[31:2] << 2) - 8) references an ARM state instruction â 0bx1 ((DBGPCSR[31:1] << 1) - 4) references a Thumb or ThumbEE state instruction â 0b10 IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED This field encodes the processor instruction set state, so that the profiling tool can calculate the true instruction address by subtracting the appropriate offset from the value sampled in bits [31:2] of the register. In Cortex-A9, the DBGPCSR samples the target address of executed branches (but possibly still speculative to data aborts), with the following encodings: â¢ DBGPCSR[31:2] contains the address of the target branch instruction, with no offset â¢ DBGPCSR[1:0] contains the execution state of the target branch instruction: â 0xb00 for an ARM state instruction â 0xb01 for a Thumb2 state instruction â 0xb10 for a Jazelle state instruction â 0xb11 for a Thumb2EE state instruction

EXSC: Exclusive accesses to certain memories are not supported to full AXI specification 
Details: 
 Any exclusive operation to PSRAM or other RAM typeâs connected to the EIM returns an incorrect response of âEXOKAYâ, indicating that exclusive writes are always successful. 

Failure: 
MIPI: Incorrect blanking packet may be sent by the MIPI DSI interface 
Details: 
 When the HBP programmed timing is shorter than the time required to transmit the smallest blanking packet (6 bytes long packet), the controller incorrectly sends a blanking packet. This incorrect behavior models the HBP for a longer period than expected while the core should decide not to send any blanking packet. The transmission of blanking packet under these conditions can only be observed in Video Synchronous Mode with pulses. 

Failure: 
MIPI: Corruption of short command packets with Word Count (WC) greater than 16âhFFEE, during video mode transmission by the MIPI Generic Interface 
Details: 
 On short packets, the WC[15:0] header field delivers the actual data payload of the packet. However, In long packets, the same field is used to indicate the size of the packetâs payload. Video Mode packet scheduler prevents Generic long packets to be generated with a size higher than 16âhFFEE. This size limit is imposed by the video mode packet scheduler since the maximum line size is 16âhFFFF minus additional security margins. The core is incorrectly filtering the short packets with WC field higher than 16âhFFEE since the size protection is applied without considering that this field now contains data and not packet size. Short packet commands are erroneously transmitted in DSI link with WC field equal to 16âhFFEE when this value is higher than 16âhFFEE. 

Failure: 
ERR005194 MIPI: On MIPI DSI, there is a possible corruption of the video packets caused by overlapping of the current line over the next line, if the configuration is programmed incorrectly when using the DPI interface 
Details: 
 For an incorrectly programmed configuration that enables the Null Packets and disables the Multiple Packets, the delay calculation is incorrectly done. Calculation of the delay time applied to the synchronization events when the Null Packets are enabled does not consider that the delay should only be applied when Multiple Packets are also enabled. This inaccuracy in the delay time might lead to an eventual overlap of current line with next line transmission resulting in the corruption of the packets. 

Failure: 
ERR007805 I2C: When the I2C clock speed is configured for 400 kHz, the SCL low period violates the I2C specification 
Details: 
 When the I2C module is programmed to operate at the maximum clock speed of 400 kHz (as defined by the I2C spec), the SCL clock low period violates the I2C spec of 1.3 uS min. The user needs to reduce the clock speed to get the SCL low time to meet the 1.3us I2C minimum required. This behavior means the SoC is not compliant to the I2C spec at 400 kHz.
