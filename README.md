Information Extraction from Hardware Errata

Lajanugen Logeswaran and MeiXing Dong

In this work we consider the problem of predicting the cause of a hardware bug and a workaround
to it, given its effect on the overall system. The input to our models is a text description of a processor
anomaly. Cause prediction is formulated as a generation problem where a brief description of the
underlying cause is generated. Predicting the workaround is formulated as a retrieval problem, where
the most relevant workarounds are retrieved given the symptoms of the bug.
